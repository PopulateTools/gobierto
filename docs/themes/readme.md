# Gobierto Themes

To style a site according to it's entity brand colors we are going to start with a basic scheme of overwriting colors on the CSS. This overwrite will be entered on the "Head HTML" field on the Admin; this way, the code will be printed on every page load, and it allows to customize any CSS on the fly without the need of deploys. 

This is a little hacky and its not meant to be a definitive solution: but it's a first step that helps us to map classes that need to be overwritten, if we decide to evolve to an UI to enable an admin user to just choose a set of colors or color. 

In this directory you can find example themed CSSs.
