          warning: "<strong>Warning</strong> When importing from a CSV file, if the
            plan is empty, terms will be added to the vocabularies associated with
            categories and custom fields as they are found, but if the plan already
            contains data, since it's an update, errors will be produced for the terms
            not found in the respective vocabularies."
